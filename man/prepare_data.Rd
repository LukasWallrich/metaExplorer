\usage{
prepare_data(
  data,
  study_label,
  es_field,
  se,
  pvalue,
  sample_size,
  variance,
  filters,
  url = NA,
  es_type = "SMD",
  article_label = NA,
  es_label = NA,
  na.rm = "es_related"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{path to the .csv file to read OR a data frame}

\item{study_label}{Character. Name of the field to use as the id/study label}

\item{es_field}{Character. Name of the field to use as the effect size}

\item{se}{Character. Name of the field to use as the standard error for the effect size.}

\item{pvalue}{Character. Name of the field to use as the p-value for the effect size.}

\item{sample_size}{Character. Name of the field to use as the sample size}

\item{variance}{Character. Name of the field to use as the sampling variances.}

\item{filters}{Character. List of fields to use as filters - can be named if different labels should be displayed}

\item{url}{Character. Field with URLs or DOIs to link to. DOIs can be in the format "10.1234/5678" or full links. Defaults to NA.}

\item{es_type}{Character. Type of effect size. Defaults to "SMD" (standardized mean difference). Check the \code{\link[metafor:escalc]{metafor::escalc()}} function for other options.}

\item{article_label}{Character. Field with article labels. Only used to report number of references in addition to number of independent samples.}

\item{es_label}{Character. Label for individual effect sizes - only needed when there are multiple effect sizes per study/sample. Defaults to NA. Defaults to NA, in that case, multiple effect sizes are simply numbered.}

\item{na.rm}{Should rows with any missing values be removed? Can be TRUE, FALSE or "es_related" -
the last is the default and drops rows with missing values for any of the variables used in the standard meta-analysis models, namely
\code{es_field}, \code{sample_size}, \code{variance}, \code{se} and \code{pvalue}. Setting this to TRUE also drops rows with missing values on any of the filters
etc, which might often be unnecessary. Conversely, setting this to FALSE might lead to issues in the model - unless you post-process the data
or change the models and analyses to be included in the app.}

}
\description{
You may want to use the \code{\link[metafor:escalc]{metafor::escalc()}} function in the metafor package to calculate effect sizes and their variances in preparation for this function.
