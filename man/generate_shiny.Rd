generate_shiny(
  dataset,
  dataset_name,
  eff_size_type_label = NA,
  models = get_model_tibble,
  save_to_folder = NA,
  launch_app = is.na(save_to_folder),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Dataframe as returned from \code{\link[=import_data]{import_data()}}}

\item{dataset_name}{Name of the dataset}

\item{eff_size_type_label}{The label to be used to describe the effect size. If NA, effect type code from dataset is used.}

\item{models}{The models to be included in the app. Can either be a function to call, a tibble, or the path to a file. If you want to change the default models, have a look at the vignette and/or the \code{\link[=get_model_tibble]{get_model_tibble()}} documentation.
Passing a file (e.g. "my_models.R") is particularly helpful if you include helper functions and save the app. If so,
this must assign the tibble to a global variable called models_to_run (i.e. using <<-).}

\item{save_to_folder}{If specified, the code and data for the app will be saved to this folder. Defaults to NA, which means that nothing will be saved. If the folder exists, the user will
be asked to confirm overwriting it - unless the script is run in non-interactive mode, in which case the folder will be overwritten without asking.}

\item{launch_app}{Should the app be launched? Defaults to TRUE if it is not saved (i.e. save_to_folder is NA), FALSE otherwise.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=create_about]{create_about}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{date}}{Date of the last update. Defaults to the current date.}
    \item{\code{citation}}{Citation requested by the author. Defaults to an empty string.}
    \item{\code{osf_link}}{Link to the OSF (or similar) project where data and materials are available. Defaults to an empty string.}
    \item{\code{contact}}{Contact information, typically email. Defaults to an empty string.}
  }}

\description{
This function generates the Shiny app. It is the main function of the package. The app can either be launched directly, or saved to
a folder. If saved, that folder will contain all the code and data needed to run the app. The app can then be launched by sourcing
the app.R file in the folder and running launch_app().
