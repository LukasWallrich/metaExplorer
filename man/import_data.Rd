\title{Import data from a file and return a data frame}
\usage{
import_data(
  data,
  study_label,
  es_field,
  se,
  pvalue,
  sample_size,
  variance,
  filters,
  url = NA,
  es_type = "SMD",
  article_label = NA,
  es_label = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{path to the .csv file to read OR a data frame}

\item{study_label}{Character. Name of the field to use as the id/study label}

\item{es_field}{Character. Name of the field to use as the effect size}

\item{se}{Character. Name of the field to use as the standard error for the effect size.}

\item{pvalue}{Character. Name of the field to use as the p-value for the effect size.}

\item{sample_size}{Character. Name of the field to use as the sample size}

\item{variance}{Character. Name of the field to use as the sampling variances.}

\item{filters}{Character. List of fields to use as filters - can be named if different labels should be displayed}

\item{url}{Character. Field with URLs or DOIs to link to. DOIs can be in the format "10.1234/5678" or full links. Defaults to NA.}

\item{es_type}{Character. Type of effect size. Defaults to "SMD" (standardized mean difference). Check the \code{\link[metafor:escalc]{metafor::escalc()}} function for other options.}

\item{article_label}{Character. Field with article labels. Only used to report number of references in addition to number of independent samples. Defaults to NA.}

\item{es_label}{Character. Label for individual effect sizes - only needed when there are multiple effect sizes per study. Defaults to NA.}
}
\value{
tibble with the data from the file reformatted for metaUI
}
\description{
You may want to use the \code{\link[metafor:escalc]{metafor::escalc()}} function in the metafor package to calculate effect sizes and their variances in preparation for this function.

\dontrun{
import_data("my_meta.csv", "study_id", "cohens_d", c("Country" = "country", "Year" = "year"))
